# CUSTOMER REVIEW SYSTEM
Reviews not only have the power to influence **consumer decisions** but can strengthen a **company's credibility**. They have the power to gain customer trust, and they encourage people to interact with the company. Customer interaction ultimately leads to improved profits for businesses. Our group has focused on the same need for a convenient and effective way to take reviews from customers which takes inputs from the users in form of *images, texts and audio.* Inputs are further pre-processed, categorized, implementation of tags, statistically analyzing each response and after a critical sentiment analysis are sent back to the dummy mail provided as a fully classified and analyzed report. We've further worked to put the model on web, so that anyone could access it.
